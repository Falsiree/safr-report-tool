# SAFR-Reporting-and-Treatment
This is a tool to help stay immersed by providing quick access to finishing up reports for GTA RP. This tool itself is aimed at those that wish to do medical roleplay from an EMT perspective.

If there any glaring issues that you might come cross using it, please don't hesitate to pop something in the issues tab and I will try my best to work on it right away.
